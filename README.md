This repository contains server mods for the game Silica.

# Silica Server Mods

## Starting Units
This mod allows the server to set the initial unit configuration. It is functional but still requires some improvements.

## Ranked
This mod contains a parser for the [logging mod](https://github.com/data-bomb/Silica/tree/v872/Si_Logging) by @databomb and another module to push the parsed information to a database. It uses the ELO system to rank commanders and a point system for FPS players. There are plans to implement a proper ranking system for FPS players.
